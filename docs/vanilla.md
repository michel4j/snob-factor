### 1 Overview

Snob is a program for clustering, that is, for discovering class
structure in a multivariate population given data on a sample
of things which are assumed to be a random sample from the
population. Given such a sample, Snob tries to find a population
model in which the statistical distribution of things is modeled as
the union of some number of class distributions. The model of
a single class is simple, modeling the distribution of each variate
with a simple unimodal statistical distribution. The model for the
whole population is a weighted sum of the class distributions, the
weight given to each class being the estimated relative abundance
of members of that class in the population.

Snob estimates the number of classes, the relative abundance
of each class, the distribution parameters for each variate within
each class, and the class to which each thing in the sample most
probably belongs. In so doing, it uses an inference principle known
as Minimum Message Length (MML). In this application, the
principal implies that the population model is used to provide
a concise encoding of the data in a message which first specifies
the model (number of classes, distribution parameters etc.), then
specifies the class to which each thing is assumed to belong, and
finally encodes the data for each thing using a code based on the
statistical distribution of the class to which the thing has been
assigned. The "best" model for the population is that which min-
imizes the total length of this message.

The MML principle has an inherent trade-off between com-
plexity of model and fit to the data. Hence, no further principle
or "significance test" is needed to choose the appropriate number
of classes.

### 3 History


The original version of Snob was written by David Boulton and
Chris Wallace in 1968 in Algol [1]. The original proved successful
in applications to do with the species of fur seals, the diagnosis of
clinical depression, the ecology of Scottish heathers, and diverse
other data. However, it gave an inconsistent method for estima-
tion, since it totally (rather than probabilistically) assigned things
to classes.

   A hierarchical version was later developed by Boulton, again
in Algol, but has been less widely used.

   A Fortran version including some algorithmic improvements
was developed by Wallace, and extended by David Dowe, over the
late 70s and 80s. In particular, Wallace 1986 [2], 1990 [3], and
Wallace and Dowe 1994 [4] correct this, with Wallace and Dowe
(1994) also introducing Poisson and von Mises circular distribu-
tions.

   The present "Vanilla" version is written in C, and has minor
algorithmic and interface improvements over the Fortran version.
It was written by Wallace in July and August 2002. It includes
only Gaussian and multistate distributions. It has slightly differ-
ent file formats as well.



### 4 Data (general)


The input data required by Snob is basically a set of records, one
for each thing or case in the data sample. Each record contains
values for each of several variables as measured or observed for
that thing. The same set of variables appears for each thing.
Thus, the sample data is essentially just a rectangular table of
values with a row (i.e. record) for each thing and a column for
each variable.

   Not every value need be known for each thing: Snob provides
for "missing" values in the table.



#### 4.1 Variable types

The Vanilla version currently provides for just two types of vari-
able, "Continuous" and "Multistate". I expect to add a third, for
angular data, shortly.
   Each variable type has a type code.


##### 4.1.1 Continuous data. Type code 1

A "continuous" variable is one that takes real values in a contin-
uum. A value of this type appears as a decimal number with or
without a fractional part, e.g. "327", "-108.2", ".777", ".0099",
"0".

   In the Snob model, the distribution of a continuous variable
within one class is modeled by a Normal or Gaussian distribution
with parameters Mean and Standard Deviation (SD).

   As this distribution form is symmetrical, and can cover both
negative and positive values, it may be inappropriate for a data
variable which is by its nature strictly positive, e.g. mass, height,
age since birth etc. It may be preferable to transform values
of such a variable by replacing them by their logarithms before
submitting to Snob. However, previous experience suggests that
this transformation makes little difference to the class structure
found, unless the values cover a wide ratio range.

   Multiplicative and/or additive scaling of continuous values, if
done uniformly to the same variable for all things, does not affect
the structure found by Snob. However, as the mean and SD es-
timates for a class distribution are printed by Snob to 6 decimal
places, prescaling to bring data values to a typical magnitude not
less than 0.1 and not more than 1000 is advisable.

   Precision: Snob takes note of the precision with which con-
tinuous data has been recorded. This precision has a small ef-
fect on the results, but may become important if some discovered
class has, for some variable, a SD not much bigger than the pre-
cision quantum. The precision quantum for a real-valued variable
is called `eps', and must be stated in the data file as described
later. Some examples may clarify the matter. Suppose that a
data variable is "bank account balance", that the data values
involved range between $1000000 credit and $300000 debt, and
balances have been recorded only to the nearest $100. Then the
limitations of the Snob output formats suggests that the data val-
ues be scaled to units of $10,000, so the data values will then
range from +100 to -30. The `eps' for the balance variable is then
0.01, because 0.01 times $10,000 is $100. Suppose another vari-
able is (a person's) age, which is to be used untransformed, and
has been recorded as an integer number of years. Then `eps' for
this variable is 1 (or 1.0), representing a quantum of one year.

   Note that the eps quantum shows the precision with which the
data values are stated, not their accuracy. For instance, systolic
blood pressures are normally recorded as an integer number (of
                        3

mm of Hg) but are rarely reproducible to better than 3 mm.
The precision of the data is then 1, even though the likely error
in each value is of order 3. `eps' should be entered as 1 or 1.0.


##### 4.1.2 Multistate variables. Type code 2

A "multistate" variable can take only a finite number of discrete
values. The possible values are termed "states", and the values
must appear in the data as integers ranging from 1 up to the
number of states. Different multistate variables may have different
numbers of states. For example, the variable "sex" could have 2
states, 1 = female, 2 = male. The integers representing the values
have no arithmetic significance. In particular, the sequence of
integers does not imply an ordering of the states.

   The vanilla version allows up to 50 states for a discrete vari-
able.

   Within a class, the statistical distribution of a discrete variable
is modeled by a multinomial distribution, i.e. by a probability for
each state, the probabilities summing to 1.



### 5 Input Files


Snob uses four sorts of input file. These are Variable-Set files,
Sample files, Member files and Population files. Hereafter, these
are referred to as vset, samp, mrep and prep files. Files of each
type must have names ending with the suffixes ".vset", ".samp",
".mrep", or ".prep".

   Snob requires at least a vset file and a samp file to do anything
useful. The use of mrep and prep files as input will be described
later.


#### 5.1 Variable Set files (vset)

A vset file specifies the name, type, and other essential information
of every variable in a sample data set. The format is as follows:

- Line 1: A name for the vset. This need not be the same as the
    name of the vset file but preferably should be the same as
    the file name less its ".vset" suffix.
- Line 2: The number of variables. That is, the number of columns
    in the data table describing a sample.

Following lines, one for each variable:

```
<Variable name> <variable type code> <other info de-
pending on variable type>
```

- For Continuous (type code 1) there is no `other info'.
- For Multistate (type code 2) the `other info' is the num-
   ber of states.

An example vset file is shown below:

```
sd1
      3
A_REAL_VAR 1
A_3-state_multi 2 3
A_binary 2 2
```

Preferably, the file name should be sd1.vset.



#### 5.2 Sample files (samp)

A samp file contains the actual sample data, with some heading
information. The format follows:

- Line 1:A name for the samp. This need not be the same as the
    name of the samp file but preferably should be the same as
    the file name less its ".samp" suffix.
- Line 2:The name of the vset describing the variables appearing
    in the sample data. Note, it is the name of the vset, not
    the name of the .vset file containing it, which should appear
    here.
- Following lines,one for each variable in the vset which requires
    some further sample-specific info. These must appear in the
    same order as the variables are listed in the vset. Some
    variable types require no sample-specific info, and need not
    have a line, but it seems a good idea to include a blank line
    for each such variable.
   - Continuous variables each require a real value for `eps',
      the precision with which values of this variable are
      known.
   - Multistate variables require no sample-specific info.
- A line:containing the sample size, i.e. the number of things in
    the sample. This concludes the heading information.
- Following lines, one for each record:Each thing in the sam-
    ple gets a record.
   - Each record must begin on a new line, but may occupy
      several lines.
   - Blank lines are ignored.
   - Each record begins with an integer thing identifier,
      which must be unique, but has no arithmetic signifi-
      cance. Identifiers need not be consecutive or in order.
   - The record for a thing continues with its data values
      listed in the same order as in the vset list of corre-
      sponding variables. Each record must contain an item
      for every variable. If the value of a variable is not
      known for the thing, it must still appear in the record
      as a "missing value" flag.
   - Items in a record are separated by one or more space,
      tab or newline characters.


#### 5.2.1 Missing Values

A missing data value appears in a samp file as a "missing value"
flag. This is a string of one or more consecutive '=' characters.
Whatever the number of '=' characters, the string represents a
single missing value.


#### 5.2.2 Example Sample file (using the example vset "sd1" above)
```
    sd1dat sd1 0.1
    300


       2000 28.12     2       2
       2001 43.71     1       2
       2002    =====     2       1
       3003 61.50     3       2
       3004 51.09     3       =
       2005 20.98     2       2
       2006 16.14     3       2
       3007 56.70     3       1
       1008    -8.83     3       2
       1009    -2.02     1       1
       3010 53.73     2       1
       3011 38.10     1       2
        etc etc.
```



### 6 Internal Storage of Vsets, Samples and Models

The present version has internal storage for just one variable set,
which will be used throughout a run.

   Snob can store up to 10 samples, which must all use the same
vset.

   It can hold up to 15 population models (which are called poplns
or models interchangeably, I fear). These may have been found
using different samples, but several different models can be held
for and applied to the same sample. A model trained on one
sample may be applied to another sample.

 At any time during the run, one sample will be the "current"
sample, and until another is selected from among the stored sam-
ples, the current one will be used in all operations.

   Stored models have names. At any time, one model will be
current, and will be used in all operations until another is picked.
The current model is named "work", and may be thought of
as an evolving model of the current sample. If a different named
model is picked from among the stored models, the current "work"
model is lost and replaced by a copy of the picked model, which is
unaltered. The current "work" model may be copied, with a new
name, into the store of models, overwriting any previous stored
model of the same name. This leaves the "work" model unchanged
and still current.

   Besides "work", there are three special model names.

- "TrialPop" is a name used for a temporary model employed
   in some operations. This name should not be used for any
   other model.
- "BST_<samplename>" is a reserved name used automati-
   cally for the best model found so far for the named sample.
   There may be several "BST_..." models automatically made
   and stored, one for each sample which has been used.
- "BSTP<samplename>" is a name applied to a model which
   was (in this or a previous run) generated as a "BST_..."
   model, recorded on a file, and in this run read back into
   model storage.


### 7 Running Snob

The Snob executable program is designed to be run in one of two
different ways.

#### 7.1 Direct execution

If the program is started as a normal terminal-started program,
it will, after a delay of a second or two, output a message like:

    Enter variable-set file name:
    There being no comms file, input will be taken from StdInput

   At this point, the user should input the name of the vset file
to be employed in the run. (the ".vset" suffix may be omitted.)
Thereafter, Snob will prompt for a sample file name and then (if
all goes well) will prompt for commands directing its actions.
   If this direct execution mode is to be used, before starting Snob
ensure that there is no file around called "comms".  Otherwise
Snob will try to read from that file, possibly waiting forever.


#### 7.2 Indirect execution

This version of Snob has a crude but platform-independent way
to execute in the background, allowing you to interrupt its search
without losing its state.1 Snob can run in the background and get
its input from a file, while a separate program ("pro") captures
keyboard input and puts it in the file.

   In this mode of use, first, remove any file named "comms".
Then start the snob-vanilla executable as a background pro-
gram, and immediately start another program called "pro" (com-
piled from source file "prompt.c").

   These three steps are best done via a command script. For
Unix-like systems, the script file "go" will do the job. It is shown
below:

```
rm comms
snob-vanilla &
pro
rm comms

```

   Indirect execution is thus initiated just by entering "go". When
so started, Snob will output the message:

```Enter variable-set file name:```

and then carry on as for direct execution.

   (For Windows-like systems, just start two command-line win-
dows in the same directory, run snob-vanilla in one, and pro in
the other.)

   The advantage of indirect execution is that it allows Snob to
be interrupted in the middle of a time-consuming operation with-
out losing state. It will stop what it is doing if a new command
or a blank line is entered from the terminal, and ask for a new
command.

   The disadvantage of indirect execution is that Snob may take
a second or two to respond to each command. Also, some catas-
trophic failures of Snob may leave the 'pro' program still running,
in which case pro has to be killed off before another run. The
prompt formatting may also be messier.


### 8 Classes, Leaves, Subclasses, POP and TC

Some confusing nomenclature has crept into Snob from earlier
versions. In the present vanilla version, a model comprises some
number of class models, only one if Snob has found no evidence for
distinct classes, or possibly quite a number. These classes together

represent the model for the sample. They are called 'leaves' and
are the principal result of a Snob run.

   However, Snob maintains in association with the "work" model
several other class models. These are not really part of the model,
but are used in the search for a better model.

   "POP" is a class model for the whole sample. That is, the
distribution of each variable over the entire sample is modeled
as a single, simple statistical distribution. This class contains all
things, and does not change unless a different sample is selected.
POP is shown in a printout of 'classes' because the overall distri-
bution of variables may be of interest, but it is not a leaf of the
model.

   Subclasses are class models which are not part of the model.
Each leaf of the model may have a pair of subclasses, which rep-
resent a potential split of the leaf into two. If Snob determines
that such a split is worthwhile, it will replace the leaf by its two
subclasses, which then become true leaves of the work model.

   TC is a class model which, like subclasses, represents a poten-
tial leaf, not a true leaf of the sample model. It represents the
potential union of two true leaves into a single leaf. If Snob de-
termines that such a union is worthwhile, it will replace the two
leaves by TC, which becomes a new leaf. There is at most one
TC class in the "work" model.

   The properties of subclasses and TC may be printed out just
as for true leaves, but usually are of little interest.

   The word "class" is used generally to refer to all class models,
not just the true leaves. Leaves are referred to as leaves.



### 9 Class Serial Numbers


Every class has a serial number.

   POP is serial 0 always.

   Leaf serials are allocated from 1 upwards as leaves are created
in the search for a good model. As leaves may be destroyed in
this search, e.g. by being replaced by subclasses, the set of leaf
serials in the current work model is not usually consecutive.

   The potential combination class TC has a serial allocated as if
it were a leaf. As most TC classes are discarded as not worthwhile,
and replaced by the potential union of a different pair of leaves,
successive TC classes will often have different serials.

   The serials of the two subclasses of a leaf whose serial is S are
shown as Sa and Sb. Thus if leaf 22 has subclasses, these have
serials 22a and 22b.



### 10 Commands (General)


When a run is started, Snob first asks for the file name of a vset
file, then for the file name of a sample file. God willing, it will accept 
these files, and construct an initial "work" model comprising
a single leaf. For example:

```
> snob-vanilla
Enter variable-set file name:
There being no comms file, input will be taken from StdInput
sd1.vset
Readvset returns 0
Enter sample file name:
sd1dat.samp

```

It will show this model in a little summary, showing the existence
of the POP class and a leaf with serial 1. For example:

```
Number of active cases = 300
Begin sort of 300 cases
Finished sort
Readsample returns 0
Allocated space     7704 chars
AaaA
Popln 1 on sample 1,   1 leaves, 300 things Cost      15.89

Assign mode Partial    --- Adjust: Params Tree
POP 0 RelAb 0.998 Size 300.0
      1 RelAb 1.000 Size 300.0
aa
Firstpop returns 0
Allocated space     9252 chars


S#     0 POP Age#    3 SampSz#    300.0 RelAb 1.000 Sz 300.0
Pcost     17.53 Tcost 2585.09 Total 2602.62

```

   For obscure reasons, it will then output a line "???  line 0"
and then expect to receive a command.

   Snob commands all begin with a lower-case key word, and
may then need some parameters. If just the key word is entered
and parameter(s) are needed, Snob will prompt with a brief de-
scription of the command and ask for the parameters.

   Unintelligible commands or parameters will usually result in
Snob's writing "???" and expecting another command.

   Command keywords may be abbreviated to a prefix, and Snob
will warn of ambiguity.


#### 10.1 Command Summary

Whenever Snob is run, it writes a file called Snob.Menu contain-
ing a summary of all commands in alphabetic order. As this is
produced by Snob itself, it may be more accurate and up-to-date
than these notes.

   As Snob.Menu is only 2 pages long, I strongly suggest that a
user print it out on paper.


#### 10.2 Help

The command "help" needs a command keyword as parameter,
and will output a brief description of the command. "help help"
will list all keys in alphabetic order.

   At present, "help" may be abbreviated to "h", and "h h" will
list all commands.



#### 10.3 Automatic Search Commands

When Snob is first started by reading in a vset and samp, the
"work" model is set up with a single leaf. Work is also left with a
single leaf after a new sample is selected.
   Snob can be asked to search for a better model by modifying
work whether or not work is in this initial one-leaf state.
   The command to perform an automatic search is "doall",
but the action of doall is subject to some settings which can be
changed using the "assign", "adjust" and "nosubs" commands
before issuing doall.


##### 10.3.1 `doall <N>`

Performs up to N cycles of attempted improvement. A cycle basi-
cally consists of assigning things to classes, collecting statistics for
each class from the things assigned to it, and then re-estimating
the classes' abundance and variable distribution parameters.

   As well as these basic operations, a cycle may:

   - Add subclasses to a leaf.
   - Destroy subclasses of a leaf if they seem to offer no hope of
    improvement.
   - Split a leaf, i.e. replace it by its subclasses which then be-
    come leaves.
   - Destroy a leaf which has become too small.
   - Choose a pair of leaves to combine to form a TC potential
    leaf.
   - Destroy the TC class if it seems to offer no hope of improve-
    ment.
   - Combine the two leaves of the TC class, i.e., replace the two
    leaves by TC, which then becomes a leaf.
   - If "work" is better than the stored model "BST_<samplename>"
    (i.e. has a shorter message length), copies work into BST_...

Some of these additional operations are only attempted every 10
cycles or so.

   While doall is cycling, it outputs a character on every cycle.

If the cycle improves the model, it outputs `A', otherwise `a'. Splits
and combines are reported.

   If doall finds no improvement for about 60 consecutive cycles,
it gives up even although it may not have completed N cycles.

   If Snob was started in indirect mode, entering a blank line or
new command while doall is in progress will stop doall at the
end of the current cycle.


##### 10.3.2 `assign <c>`

Normally, doall allows for the fact that the class of a thing may be
uncertain, given the present work model. It then partially assigns
the thing several classes, in proportion to its probability of being
a member of the class. This is the default assignment mode, and
for a given model, leads to the shortest message length.

   The assign <c> command allows the assignment mode to be
altered. The character <c> selects the new mode.

   - "assign p" sets the normal, "Partial" mode.
   - "assign m" sets the "most_likely" mode, in which a thing
   is assigned to the class most likely to contain it. Most_likely
   mode can lead to inconsistent estimates of class parame-
   ters if many things have uncertain membership, so it is not
   recommended as a permanent setting. However, doing a
   few cycles in this mode and then reverting to Partial mode
   may sometimes help Snob to escape from a local sub-optimal
   minimum.
   - "assign r" sets Random mode. In this mode, a thing is
   assigned to a class selected at random in proportion to the
   probabilities of its belonging to the different classes. As the
   assignment is freshly chosen on each cycle, the model will
   jitter about a bit. The use of Random mode for a number
   of cycles may help Snob to escape from a local sub-optimal
   minimum.

Assign settings remain until another assign command is given but
may revert to Partial if work is overwritten.


##### 10.3.3 `adjust <paramstring>`

This command changes setting which enable cycles to modify
work.

   - "adjust p-" inhibits changes to class distribution parameters,
   - "adjust p+" enables them.
   - "adjust t-" inhibits changes to class structure, in particular, splitting and combining.
   - "adjust t+" enables them.

Both settings may be set in a single command, e.g.  "adjust
t-p+".  "adjust a+" and "adjust a-" control both parameter
and structure changes.


##### 10.3.4 `nosubs <N>`

"nosubs 1" destroys all subclasses and stops the making of new
ones. This applies even if the adjust setting allows structure
changes.

   "nosubs 0" reverts to the default situation where subclasses
may be made provided the adjust setting allows.


#### 10.4 Manual Structure Change Commands

These allow alteration to "work" without use of doall. In the
descriptions following, 'S' refers to a class serial number, or a
serial number followed by 'a' or 'b' if a subclass is meant.

- `kclass <S>` Destroys the class.
- `ksons <S>` Destroys the subclasses of leaf S.
- `splitleaf <S>` If leaf S has subclasses, replaces S by its sub-
    classes which become new leaves.
- `combine <S1> <S2>` Combines leaves S1 and S2 into a single
    leaf.
- `flatten` Splits all splittable leaves, then sets NOSUBS.
- `ranclass <N>` Replaces all leaves of work by N leaves with ran-
    domly selected members.

    The classes should have approximately equal sizes, but some
    may fail to attract enough members to survive.

    If ranclass is later done again, a different set of classes will
    be generated, even if N is the same as previously.

- `Rmrep <F>`  Reads in a file named F.mrep, which must have a
    format resembling that produced by the "mrep" command,
    which see under the general heading of reporting commands.
    The file must refer to the current sample.

    The effect is to replace work by a new work model with leaves
    having the serial numbers given in the file, and distribution
    parameters which are estimates based on the things named
    in the class beginning with that serial. The new work model
    is then subjected to one doall cycle.

    Not all members of the sample need be mentioned in the
    file. The aim is to set up a model based on the user's guess
    as to what might be typical things in suspected classes.

    The required format is shown below, "junk" meaning any
    strings not extending onto a new line.

    - Line 1:VanillaSnob-Member-Report-File
    - Line 2:Sample `<name of current sample>`
    - Line 3:`<number of classes>` junk
    - Lines :Then some number of lines (maybe none) contain-
        ing any junk not including '+'.
    - Next line:+

    Then for each class:a block of lines with the format:

   - Line 1:Class <class serial number>
   - Following lines:A list of thing identifiers, each be-
      ing the identifier of some member of the current
      sample. The list is terminated by "-1". This ends
      the class block.

Files produced by the mrep command are acceptable as in-
put files for rmrep, and will more or less reconstruct the
model from which the file was produced. However, as the file
does not provide for partial assignment of things to classes,
the reconstructed model will in general be slightly different
from the original.



#### 10.5 Commands about Models

Snob may store several models internally. Each model has a name,
and is stored at some "index" or address in the model store. In-
dexes are chosen by Snob and may be reused.

- `pops` Lists the indices and names of each model in the model
    store. When a model is to be specified as a parameter in a
    command, either its name (a character string) or its index
    may be used.

    In command descriptions, `<P >` refers to a model name or
    index.

- `kpop <P>`  Destroys model P. Its index becomes available for
    reuse. Model "work" may not be destroyed. If model "BST_(current
    sample name)" is destroyed, it is immediately replaced by a
    copy of work.

- copypop `<P>`  Copies work to the model store as a new model
    called P. The stored model will have no subclasses or TC
    class.

    `<P>` may not be "work" or "Trial_Pop".

- `pickpop <P>` Replaces work with a copy of model P, which re-
    mains in store. The copy is, of course, named "work".

    The current sample is modeled by the new work, and a mes-
    sage length computed.

- `save <P>` Writes a copy of model P to a file named "P.save".
    This is a binary file, and so is not in general transferable
    among different types of computer or operating system. The
    advantage of 'save' as compared to 'prep' (which reports a
    model description in a readable text file) is that the binary
    .save file holds an exact representation of the model, whereas
    a .prep file has parameters etc. rounded to a modest number
    of decimal digits.

    If P is "work", save requires a second parameter which will
    be used as the name of the filed model instead of "work".
    The form then is "save work <newname>" and the file will
    be called newname.save.

    If P begins with "BST_" (or is the index of a model with
    such a name) the filed model will be called "BSTP..." and
    its file name will use this modified name. The purpose is
    that the model can then be restored in this or a later run
    without overwriting a possibly better model then in store.

- `rsave < F >` Tries to read a file named "F.save". If successful,
    installs the saved model in the model store at the lowest
    vacant index. Any previous stored model named F is de-
    stroyed. work is not affected.

- `rprep < F >` Tries to read a file from a ".prep" file (see command
    "prep" below). If successful, installs a model whose name
    is taken from the file, and is normally F.

    The file defines the model in terms of its number of leaves,
    the sizes of each leaf, and the distribution parameters of
    each variable within each leaf.  "rprep" does not use all
    the information in a .prep file as produced by the command
    "prep".  The fields it actually uses are the first two lines
    (a heading file and the model name), and then such fields
    as are preceded by a '#' character in the .prep file. Other
    fields are ignored.

It is fairly easy to prepare manually an acceptable .prep
file. This allows a user to suggest a classification in terms
of its number of classes, their relative abundances, and the
parameters of their variable distributions.

A manually-prepared .prep file should begin with the same
text lines as would be found in a file made by the "prep"
command.


- Line 1:"VanillaSnob-Model"

- Line 2:`<model name>`, preferably the same as the file
    name without .prep. After these 2 lines, rprep only
    reads fields which are preceded by a `#' character.
    Other fields which are produced by "prep" are ignored.
    A manual .prep file can thus continue simply as under:
- Line 3:#`<variable-set name>`
- Line 4:#`<sample name>`, which will be ignored. Use
    "???".
- Line 5:#`<sample size> #<cost>` (These numbers must
    be present, but will have no meaning in a manual .prep
    file.)
- Line 6:#`<number of leaf classes>`

Then follow sections, one for each leafCclass:ommand
- "prep" begins with a section for the POP `class', but
omit this, and include only sections for leaves. The
section for a leaf begins with a line:

- 7a:#<serial number> #<age> #<size>

Then the section for a leaf continues with a record for
each variable. All variables in the variable-set must be
included in the same order. Each record begins:

- 7b # <`s' or `I'>
(`s' indicates the variable is significant, `I' that it
isn't.)

- 7c # <sample size>
(If this value is less than 2.0, or is greater than
the `class size', it is replaced by the class size. It
is used to indicate that following parameter values
have uncertainties of order (1 / sqrt(sample size)).)

- 7d The rest of the record lists the distribution param-
eters for the variable distribution within the class:

- 7d (continuous):# <Mean> #<Standard De-
   viation>
   (for a continuous variable)

- 7d (multistate)# <prob 1> # <prob 2> . . . #<prob
   n>
   (For a multistate with n states.) These proba-
   bilities will be normalized by "rprep".

   The serial numbers of classes must be integers at least 1, all
   distinct but not necessarily consecutive or in order.

   The age is ignored (taken as 2).

   The sizes determine the relative abundances of the various
   classes, and must all be at least 1.0. They also determine
   the supposed accuracy of the parameter values, small sizes
   implying wide uncertainty.

   When the model is applied to a sample, a POP class is
   added to the model with parameters estimated from the
   sample. These parameters, and the input class 'sizes', will
   affect the 'Parameter Cost' (Pcost) ascribed to the model,
   so the model may show different Pcosts when applied to
   different samples. None of this is important if the model
   is just used as the starting point for a model search using
   "doall".

   Of course, if "rprep" reads a .prep file produced by the
   "prep" command, the presence of a POP class (serial 0) as
   the first class section causes Snob to take the leaf ages, class
   sizes, variable samplesizes etc. seriously, and it does not
   fiddle them.



#### 10.6 Commands about Samples

- `samps` This command lists the names and indices of the samples
    held in the sample store. One of these will be the current
    sample to which work applies.

- `readsample <F>` Reads a sample from file "F.samp" and in-
    stalls it in the sample store at the lowest available index.
    The sample name is taken from the first line of the file, and
    is not necessarily `<F>`.

    The vset used for the sample must be the current vset.

    The work model is unaffected, and the current sample un-
    changed.

- `select <D>`Command `select <D>` requires D to be either the
    name or the index of some sample in the sample store. If
    D is the current sample, the command says so and does
    nothing.

    Otherwise, D is selected as the current sample, and work
    is replaced by a one-leaf model of the new sample, or, if a
    BST_model is known, by it.

    Just in case, the old work model is copied to the model store
    with the name OldWork.

    As often the use of select will be to see how the selected
    sample is modeled by an existing model, select turns off
    adjustment of class parameters and model structure.
                       17

#### 10.7 Commands for Reporting

sum Just shows the current classes.

- `prclass <S>`<0 or 1>prclass prints the properties of class se-
    rial S, briefly if 0 and giving the parameters for each variable
    if 1. If the latter, a "significance" indication is shown for
    each variable. This shows if the distribution of the variable
    within class S differs significantly from its distribution in
    POP, and if so, a percentage significance level which needs
    to be taken with a grain of salt.

    If S = -1, POP and all leaves are reported. If S = -2,
    subclasses and TC are included.

- `prep <P>` Writes a description of model P onto a file named
    P.prep. The description names the current sample then in
    effect does a "prclass -1 1" report writing to the file.

    If P is "work", prep requires a second parameter which will
    be used as the name of the filed model instead of "work".
    The form then is "prep work <newname>" and the file will
    be called newname.prep.

    A .prep file may be read back in by the "rprep" command
    and will store a new model with the name being taken from
    the .prep file, overwriting any previous model of the same
    name. A .prep file may be prepared manually using some
    text editor, containing a suggested population model. The
    required format need not follow exactly that of files pro-
    duced by "prep". See the "rprep" command.

- `mrep <F> ` Writes to a file named F.mrep. It shows the current
    sample name, the number of leaves, the leaf serials and sizes,
    and then lists for each leaf the identifiers of those things
    assigned to the leaf by Most_Likely assignment. The thing
    list for each leaf is terminated by -1.

    A .mrep file may be read in later provided the current sample
    is the one for which the file was written, and will then replace
    work by a rough reconstruction of the work model at the
    time it was written. See the "rmrep" command.

- `trep <F>` Writes to a file named F.trep. It shows the current
    sample name, number of leaves, leaf serials and sizes, and
    then writes a line for each thing in the sample, in identifier
    order. The line for a thing gives its identifier, then the serials
    of up to 5 leaves to which the thing might belong, in order
    of decreasing probability.

    The probability follows each leaf serial as a percentage in
    brackets. Probabilities greater than 98.5% are shown as
    (99). Leaves with probability less than 0.5% are not shown.

    A .trep file cannot be used as input.
                       18

- `crosstab <P>`Displays a cross-tabulation or contingency table
    between work and stored model P. The table has a row for
    each leaf of work and a column for each leaf of P.

    A table entry for leaf serial Sw of work and leaf serial Sp
    of P shows the permillage2 of all active things which are in
    both leaves. Crosstab <work> is also meaningful. Here, an
    entry for leaves S1, S2 shows the permillage of things which
    are partially assigned to both classes.

- `tree` This command draws a (possibly multi-rooted) binary tree
    with the leaf classes of work as its leaves. The tree is based
    on a sort of Bhattacharyya Coefficient of similarity among
    the leaf distributions. The classic Bhattacharyya Coefficient
    between two probability distributions f(x) and g(x) over a
    discrete set X, where 'x' ranges over the members of X, is
    defined as
   ```    
                              X p ________
                  BC(f, g) =      f(x) . g(x)   (1)
                              x2X
   ```
    BC(f, g) = 1 iff f(x) = g(x) for all x, and is zero iff f(x) *
    g(x) = 0 for all x.

    To build the tree, each leaf is regarded as defining a dis-
    tribution over the things in the current sample. In these
    distributions, the relative abundances of the classes are ig-
    nored, so if f(x) is the distribution for class F, f(x) is the
    probability that a random instance of a thing in class F
    would have the attribute values of thing x, but the distibu-
    tion is normalized so that the sum of f(x) over all things in
    the sample is one.

    For every pair of classes, the BC is calculated. Then the
    pair of classes with the highest BC is joined together in the
    tree, and effectively replaced by a "parent" class. The dis-
    tribution defined by the (size-weighted) union of the pair is
    then used to calculate the BC coefficient between the parent
    and all remaining unjoined classes. The new lowest BC is
    then found, and that pair (which may or may not include
    the new parent) is joined.

    This process continues until either only one class remains,
    or no pair of remaining classes has a BC greater than zero
    (to double-precision floating point accuracy). The remain-
    ing class(es) form the root(s) of the hierarchy of leaves and
    parents.

#### 10.8 Run Control Commands

- `file <F>`After a file F command, Snob will read F to obtain
    future commands. As each command from F is started, it
    is displayed preceded by ===.

    The file F may contain (sensibly only as its last line) a
    "file" command, which will switch the source of commands
    to the named file. The named file may be F itself, in which
    case the commands in F will be repeated over and over.
    This looping is actually useful. Snob's automatic search
    command "doall" is not guaranteed to find the global op-
    timum model, so a loop of commands such as :

   ```
   doall 200
   save BST_
   ranclass 3
   file xxx
   ```
    in a file named xxx will generate a variety of models, saving
    the best in a file named BSTP<samplename>.saveMore
    elaborate loops, using Random assignment mode for some
    doalls and using several ranclass numbers, may be used
    to advantage.

    If any command in F fails, or if the end of F is reached
    without another file command, command source reverts to
    normal keyboard input.

    If Snob was started in indirect mode, typing any command
    or a blank line while Snob is busy in a file of commands will
    cause Snob to revert to normal input after completing its
    current action or a doall cycle.

- `stop` stop stops a run. This command cannot be abbreviated.


#### 10.9 The run log

Snob writes a file called run.log on which it records every com-
mand obeyed. The format is such that if the run.log file is re-
named or copied to, say, "timber", then a new run in which the
first command entered is "file timber" should reproduce the
original run. Useful in reproducing crashes.
